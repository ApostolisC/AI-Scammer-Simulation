## üé® Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python (Backend/Server)
```python
# Follow PEP 8
# Use type hints
def process_request(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> ResponseModel:
    """Process incoming request data.
    
    Args:
        data: Request data dictionary
        
    Returns:
        Processed response model
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If data is invalid
    """
    pass

# Use dataclasses for structured data
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ApiResponse:
    success: bool
    data: Optional[Any] = None
    error: Optional[str] = None
```

#### TypeScript (Frontend)
```typescript
// Use strict TypeScript
// Define proper interfaces
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onSubmit: (data: FormData) => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

// Use proper error handling
const handleApiCall = async (): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    const response = await api.call();
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API call failed:', error);
    // Handle error
  }
};

// Export components properly
export default ComponentName;
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Backend Tests
```python
# test_new_feature.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from server import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_new_endpoint():
    """Test the new endpoint functionality"""
    response = client.post("/api/new-endpoint", 
        json={"test": "data"},
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer test-key"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["success"] is True

class TestNewFeature:
    def test_validation(self):
        """Test input validation"""
        # Test implementation
        pass
    
    def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test error conditions"""
        # Test implementation  
        pass
```

### Frontend Tests
```typescript
// NewComponent.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import NewComponent from './NewComponent';

describe('NewComponent', () => {
  test('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<NewComponent title="Test" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('handles user interaction', () => {
    const onSubmit = jest.fn();
    render(<NewComponent onSubmit={onSubmit} />);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Submit'));
    expect(onSubmit).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd server
pytest

# Frontend tests  
cd frontend
npm test

# All tests with coverage
pytest --cov=. && cd ../frontend && npm test -- --coverage
```
